# 7DTD Mod | Craftable Engine | ServerSided A21

This mod allows you to craft the small engine. It will be Unlocked with the Minibike
It based on my Mod "Craftable Engine" for A20.
I removed the Camshaft and changed recipes. Now it is Serversided.

I don't know if EAC needs to be turned off, but I always play without EAC due to mods!
